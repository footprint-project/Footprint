# Project Footprint

The Footprint humanitarian responder environmental impact calculator is a full-stack application that will give organizations the opportunity to upload their data and view a timeline-based breakdown of the environmental impacts.
The data is broken down into three categories: travel, living, and shipping. To upload their information into the application, users will enter the website on the home screen and have an option to download an Excel spreadsheet template. Once the Excel spreadsheet is filled out, the information will be uploaded to the application as a CSV.
Once the data is uploaded, users will be directed to the user dashboard where they will see a breakdown of the organization’s carbon footprint. Initially, the environmental impact data is broken down organization-wide. Options will also exist to break down the data by project type, country or mission. Organizations will be compelled to create an account with the Footprint humanitarian responder environmental impact calculator to view a timeline-based breakdown of their data.
The Footprint Project describes itself as a new startup that “combines sustainability consulting with clean energy deployment to help humanitarian responders truly fulfill their commitment to first do no harm.” Footprint has deployed a beta version of this calculator (footprintproject.io), but the organization is seeking an updated application that will give organization more information about their environmental impacts.
